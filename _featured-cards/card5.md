<p>Vulnerable members of society such as the young and the elderly in rural areas may not have access to the same quality of care as their urban counterparts. In addition, practices of health among these individuals may not be up-to-standard with the latest recommendations, and health knowledge may be scarce to come by.</p>

<p>Our team has a doctor on board who has been practicing for over 30 years in general medicine. We will give free consultations to those who are looking for general health advice and distribute vitamins to underserved communities.</p>

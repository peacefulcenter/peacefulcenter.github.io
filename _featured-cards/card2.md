<p>Despite recent advancements in technology, rural areas still greatly lag behind their urban peers. Many roads still remain unpaved, and many individuals have to walk in darkness when they have to work past dusk. We contribute towards the development of rural infrastructure so that people may travel in humane conditions.</p>

<p>Over half of rural areas in Vietnam still do not have clean and reliable access to water. Specifically, only 34.8% of rural Vietnamese residents have access to clean water, while 84.2% of urban residents do, according to Asia News Network.</p> 

<p>Even when water is accessed, it may not meet quality standards. UNICEF notes that 44% of household water samples tested positive for contamination.</p>

<p>We contribute towards the development of clean wells to allow these families to get access to the fundamental building block of life.</p>
